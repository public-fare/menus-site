# When a Woman Collects Menus <small>Sifting Stories and Histories of Frank E. Buttolph’s Research Collection</small>

The collection of historic menus at the New York Public Library (NYPL) was created by a woman named Frank E. Buttolph. From the beginning, she intended the collection to be a research collection. In much of what has been written and documented (and repeated over and over again) about the menu collection, commentators launch into discussions of the collection’s size and richness, pausing momentarily to regret the paucity of information available about its creator. According to this common trope, Buttolph is a “mysterious and passionate figure” [cite: NYPL web site] who led a “quite private life” [cite: Ryley Biblion] about which (regrettably) not much can be known [cite: Federman blog]. Yet in trying to make good on Buttolph’s original intent—that the collection be used for research—and also in trying to curate the digital data set that NYPL has created from this physical collection, we found ourselves unable to accept the historical absence of the collection’s creator.
