      <h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>

      <p>As part of the <em>What’s on the Menu?</em> project site, the New York Public Library (NYPL) explains that "all data generated through <em>What's on the Menu?</em> is available in two ways"—through an application programming interface (with an access key provided upon request by the library) or a downloadable package of “spreadsheet exports.” Since these downloadable files are the most frictionless way to obtain the NYPL data, we will focus on describing them. The goal of this document is to supply additional documentation about the data files that isn't available elsewhere.</p>

      <p>The data files are available from: <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/data">http://menus.nypl.org/data</a></p>

      <p>Clicking on the link labeled "latest data export in CSV format ([DATE])" should automatically start a download in most browsers. It may be necessary to right click on a link and select an option to “save” or “download” files.</p>

      <p>The download will consist of a single compressed (zipped) tar file. To use the data, it will be necessary to unzip and untar this file. You can probably accomplish this by simply double clicking on the downloaded file. After doing so, the result will be a folder containing four csv files. These files should be named: &quot;Dish.csv&quot;, “Menu.csv”, “MenuItem.csv”, and “MenuPage.csv”.</p>
      <p>The files can be opened in any plain-text editor or in common spreadsheet applications (Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) though some of them&mdash;MenuItem.csv, for example&mdash;are very large files.</p>

      <h4 id="data-files-tables-models">Data Files, Database Tables, and Data Models</h4>

      <p>Each spreadsheet file corresponds to a table from the relational database that underlies the <em>What’s on the Menu?</em> web application. The files can be linked together by mapping shared identifiers that appear in multiple tables. (We will say more about these links below).</p>

      <p>Each file (representing a database table) corresponds to a data "model"—an abstraction used to group and organize data values. These data models were designed by the creators of the <em>What’s on the Menu?</em> web application and are meant to correspond to objects in the real world domain. In some cases, these correspondences are straightforward: “Dish.csv” records data stored in a database table organized according to an abstract model of a dish of food. A dish in this case has a “name” and other relevant attributes. For some of the data files, the domain object modeled needs further explanation.</p>

      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt><strong>Dish.csv</strong></dt>
        <dd>Information about all the dishes from all the menus transcribed by the project. In this data file, a dish is represented by a row of values. Columns identify attributes of a dish. One of these attributes is an identifier, which identifies the dish. However, the identity of a dish appears to be based on the exact form of the string labeled "name." Thus, dishes with variant orthographic forms of their names, e.g. “half chicken”, “Half Chicken” and “chicken [half]”) are treated as separate entries with different identifiers.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Menu.csv</strong></dt>
        <dd>Information about the menus as physical objects, including historical information about their origins, uses, and formats.</dd>

        <dt><strong>MenuItem.csv</strong></dt>
        <dd>This is the largest data file. A "MenuItem" represents a single instance of a dish appearing somewhere on a menu page image. “MenuItem.csv” is useful as a mapping between multiple other data files/tables.</dd>

        <dt><strong>MenuPage.csv</strong></dt>
        <dd>Information about individual pages of the menus represented in "Menu.csv". Pages are modeled here as digital images produced as a result of digitization by the NYPL. Menus often have multiple pages.</dd>

      <p>In the tables below we provide information about each downloadable data file including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>a gloss of the column labels,</li>
        <li>the datatype of values that appear in each column,</li>
        <li>an indication of whether columns have missing data (in the form of empty values),</li>
        <li>the source of values in that column,</li>
        <li>plus any additional notes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Briefly, for clarity, we define a few of the terms used below to refer to datatypes. For (much) more detail, see the Wikipedia entry on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">"Data types"</a>:</p>

      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt><strong>id</strong></dt>
        <dd>(identifier) here means a special type of string (see below). Identifiers distinguish individual objects and can also be used to link together multiple tables. In our tables we’ve reserved the use of "id" as a data type to refer to the connecting keys (technically called “primary keys” and “foreign keys”) from database tables.</dd>

        <dt><strong>integer</strong></dt>
        <dd>A numeric data type representing the "whole" numbers.</dd>

        <dt><strong>float</strong></dt>
        <dd>(floating point number) is a numeric data type that represents fractional values. In our data set these are represented as decimal values.</dd>

        <dt><strong>string</strong></dt>
        <dd>A data type representing a sequence of characters. In our data set we use &quot;string&quot; to refer to sequences of alphanumeric characters.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h5><em>Missing Data</em></h5>
      <p>We note the presence of missing data points in the column &quot;missing values.&quot; However, there are also strings in the present data that point to missing information (e.g. “unknown” or “?”), which do not formally appear as null values.</p>

      <h5><em>Who made this data point?</em></h5>
      <p>The data in these files comes from several different sources. We reflect this in the &quot;generated by&quot; category of the tables below. Some of the data is supplied by “volunteer transcribers,” by which we mean people who have participated in the project through the <em>What’s On the Menu?</em> site. Some of the information is generated by “web application.” This means that some of this information was automatically created as the database supporting the application was constructed and populated (e.g., various ids); some is created as the web application runs (e.g. timestamps as data values are updated). Finally, a lot of information is generated from “NYPL metadata.” This metadata comes from many places and reflects the long history of the project and the many parts of New York Public Library involved in it. Much of the data “supplied by NYPL metadata” in the menu spreadsheet is from the catalog cards made by Frank E. Buttolph in the early twentieth century.</p>
