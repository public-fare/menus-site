            The Collection
            </h4>
            <p>The New York Public Library Rare Book Division holds over 45,000 historical menus. About half of these were collected and curated by Frank E. Buttolph between 1900 and 1921. The menus date from the 1850s to the present and include menus from restaurant, railroad and steamship companies, as well as a range of other organizations. </p>

            The Crowd
            </h4>
            <p>Beginning in 2011, menus from the NYPL's collection were digitized and transcribed with the help of thousands of volunteers. Through the NYPL’s <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/">What’s on the Menu?</a> project, volunteers looked at digitized copies of the menus and typed in the many pieces of information included on each one, such as restaurant names, locations, dishes, prices, and dates. </p>

            The Data
            </h4>
            <p>After getting the menu data through the NYPL’s API, Trevor Munoz and collaborators at the MITH (Maryland Insitute for Technology in the Humanities) cleaned and organized it (which you can read about <a href="http://www.trevormunoz.com/notebook/2013/08/08/what-is-on-the-menu-more-work-with-nypl-open-data-part-one.html">here</a>).   The data set includes around 400,000 data points from the transcription project and the library's metadata on the collection for over 17,000 menus.</p>
