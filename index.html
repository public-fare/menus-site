            The Collection
            </h4>
            <p>The New York Public Library Rare Book Division holds over 45,000 historical menus. About half of these were collected and curated by Frank E. Buttolph between 1900 and 1921. The menus date from the 1850s to the present and include menus from restaurant, railroad and steamship companies, as well as a range of other organizations. Beginning in 2011, menus from the NYPL's collection were digitized and transcribed with the help of thousands of volunteers.</p>

            The Data
            </h4>
            <p>The digital data we are working with was produced through crowdsourcing transcription through the NYPL’s <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/">What’s on the Menu?</a> project.  Thousands of volunteers looked at digitized copies of the menus and typed in the many pieces of information included on each one. After getting the menu data through the NYPL’s API, Trevor Munoz and collaborators at the MITH (Maryland Insitute for Technology in the Humanities) worked on cleaning and organizing the data (which you can read about <a href="http://www.trevormunoz.com/notebook/2013/08/08/what-is-on-the-menu-more-work-with-nypl-open-data-part-one.html">here</a>).   The data set includes around 400,000 data points from over 17,000 menus and provides information about restaurant names, locations, dishes, prices, dates, and sometimes a few notes about the menu as an artifact. </p>
